# Node Js sample code for Visa API calls

## Installation

Install the pakcage using 
	
	$ npm install

## Usage

Update the `configuration.json` file under the `config` folder. For more information on `configuration.json` refer :
	 
* [Manual](https://github.com/visa/SampleCode/wiki/Manual)


Run Visa API calls using the command below:

You would need to generate a Call Id for calling Visa Checkout. The documentation for generating Call Id can be found at :

* [Visa Checkout Guide](https://github.com/visa/SampleCode/wiki/Visa-Checkout)

The sample code provided reads the credentials from configuration file as plain text. As a best practice we recommend you to store the credentials in an encrypted form and decrypt while using them.
